          <p>
            Every now and again, I get the chance to collect yet another
            evidence of the existence of a phenomenon that can expose the true
            quality of a certain piece of software: The fear of change. We are
            working in a dynamic business and technological environment. In such
            an environment, change is sometimes the only constant. Yet, it is
            not as rare as one would expect to find people, groups, and even
            entire organizations that do not welcome changes. When I talk about
            changes in this context, I do not refer to ongoing and extreme
            changes in the requirements. Such often changes (which eXtreme
            Programming claims we should embrace) are thoroughly discussed in
            the article Requirements Instability. What I call the “Fear of
            Change” is a more fundamental rejection of changes; even changes
            that are part of the natural evolution of a product are not gladly
            implemented. Fear of change could appear in various contexts. Here
            are just a few examples: The development team is not excited to
            implement a new feature in their product. Developers are worried
            about porting an existing product to a new platform. System
            engineers are reluctant to use new technology. Developers tend to
            stick to old (sometimes obsolete) service components instead of
            replacing them with better ones. People are afraid of an
            organizational change that might cause them to interact with new
            people. Developers are afraid to change the internal structure of
            the code, even though something is clearly wrong. If you find all
            the above examples unfamiliar, you are probably working in a very
            healthy and mature organization. However, chances are that you came
            across at least one of these scenarios, or a similar one. Naturally,
            not all changes should be automatically implemented. But when you
            are facing colleagues who repeatedly reject (or disapprove) changes,
            something is clearly wrong. In most of cases, the one disapproving
            of the change has a “very good” reason for doing so. The most common
            reason for rejecting changes is a poor quality product. Now, I am
            not talking about a product that fails to meet its functional
            requirements. I am talking about a product that passed all the
            functional tests in spite of its poor quality. Poor source code, for
            example, could generate a product that complies with the functional
            requirements, but which is a maintenance nightmare. The author of
            such source code is not likely to be thrilled of implementing
            additional features in the product or changing some aspect of the
            implementation. If the developer who should implement the change is
            not the original author of the code, the situation gets worst. The
            new developer who should maintain the code might not understand all
            aspects of the source code. The code could be cryptic to an extent
            that there is no chance to fully understand it in a reasonable
            effort. This is the ultimate reason to avoid changes: how can you
            change something you do not fully understand? The poor design might
            have a similar effect. If the product was poorly designed, it might
            be a risky task to replace some service component with a new one.
            The developer of such a poorly designed product will do anything to
            avoid replacing the “good old” component. Another kind of problem
            that might motivate fear of changes is poor testing. If you do not
            have a good and automatic regression test for the product, every
            change in its implementation becomes a major risk. The same applies
            both to QC and to developer tests. A developer who created an
            extensive set of unit tests to accompany her product will be
            confident in any changes she might be required to implement in it.
            As a general conclusion, chronic “Fear of Change” is a clear symptom
            of poor quality. A developer scared of introducing changes to her
            creation is insecure with her product. Most of the time, such
            insecurity has very good reasons to emerge. The problem with fear of
            change is that if the change is finally implemented, no one seems to
            remember the original reaction towards it. In such a case, the
            quality of the product remains poor. Sometimes, it might even get
            worst, because the change was implemented as a patch in a way that
            avoids the real problems in the product. It is better to use the
            fear of change as a warning sign. If you are facing a “Fear of
            Change” case, you would be better starting to examine the internals
            of the product, trying to find out the real reasons for rejecting
            the change. Overcoming the local resistance without a thorough
            investigation of the symptom’s origins will come to haunt you in the
            future, as new features, components or platforms will have to be
            introduced. A final note about the sociology of the “Fear of Change”
            phenomenon: fear of change always starts at the single person level,
            but it could rapidly infect entire teams and organizations. It is
            common to see an entire team unwilling to introduce a change to a
            product. The reason is that poor quality is seldom local. Various
            parts of a product implemented by the same team are likely to be of
            the same quality. So the fact that it is not a single person who
            rejects a potential change does not necessarily suggest the
            rejection is justified.
