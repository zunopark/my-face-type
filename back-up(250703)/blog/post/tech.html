            Advantage And Disadvantage Of Science And Technology (Exploring the
            gender gap in engineering: A re-specification and test of the
            hypothesis of cumulative advantages and disadvantages) 1.
            INTRODUCTION If this standard framing of the hypothesis of
            cumulative advantages and disadvantages is correct, then gender
            differences in factors that promote participation at every stage of
            the education pipeline should favor men. However, the results of
            more recent studies are mixed, with some continuing to report
            advantages for men, while others find no gender differences or
            gender differences that favor women.14-18 These results suggest that
            the gender distribution of advantages and disadvantages must be
            treated as an empirical question. We begin by asking whether male
            and female engineering undergraduates differ across factors that
            promote choice of an engineering major, persistence in engineering
            and progress in engineering. Finding that they do, we then ask two
            interrelated, yet distinct, questions. (1) Do advantages and
            disadvantages accumulate as men and women move through the education
            pipeline? (2) Does the gendered distribution of advantages and
            disadvantages for engineering undergraduates provide evidence for
            the standard framing of the hypothesis of cumulative advantages and
            disadvantages (i.e., micro-inequities favoring men) or do different
            factors advantage (and, therefore, disadvantage) men and women as
            our re-specification suggests? In our conclusion, we discuss the
            implications of our answers to these questions for ongoing research
            on the gender gap in engineering.

            II. GENDER AND THE ACCUMULATION OF ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
            Tests of the hypothesis of cumulative advantages and disadvantages
            have concentrated on the late stages of the education pipeline
            (e.g., on post-doctoral fellows, professors). In this paper, we
            shift the focus to undergraduates and compare men and women in
            engineering across 43 factors that have been shown to affect
            enrollment, persistence, and progress in science and engineering.
            Including factors affecting the choice of an engineering major
            (i.e., family background and participation in mathematics and
            science) allows us to tap advantages and disadvantages that begin to
            accumulate in high school or before. By including factors that have
            been shown to affect progress at later stages of the education
            pipeline (i.e., engineering self-efficacy, sex-based discrimination
            and integration), we can understand better the temporal dimension of
            the gendered distribution of advantages and disadvantages. For each
            factor, a significant gender difference identifies an advantage for
            one gender and a corresponding disadvantage for the other. Higher
            values indicate advantages for all factors except sex-based
            discrimination.
