            Machine learning is focused on enabling machines and robotics to
            perform practical tasks and actions that are being carried out by
            humans. From autonomous cars to deliver packages to the right shelf,
            machine learning is using the power of artificial intelligence to
            create powerful and efficient work environments. But these are all
            general explanations about machine learning. How are we supposed to
            perceive machine learning, and how is it related to AI? What is the
            future of machine learning in practical applications? These are some
            questions that we are going to explore in this guide about machine
            learning, and it’s relation with AI. What is Machine Learning (ML)?
            The general definition of machine learning explains it as a process
            of enabling the computer systems and machines to make predictive
            moves according to the environment, based on the stored data and
            instructions. The predictive movements can be related to any field
            of life. The goal of the machine can be differentiating males and
            females from the given database or counting the number of people in
            a room. From small actions like writing captions for YouTube videos
            to predict the sale growth, machine learning can do anything if
            programmed intelligently. You might be wondering that how machine
            learning programs are different from simple computer programs. Well,
            a simple computer program is based on different scenarios to
            differentiate males from females. But in the case of machine
            learning, the system is fed with huge data with different attributes
            of both genders. The data can be millions of pictures of other
            factors like weight, height, and body shape to differentiate males
            and females. Machine learning empowers the systems and machines to
            learn from the given data and instructions. The more availability of
            data and information makes machine learning more reliable and
            accurate. Difference between Machine Learning and Artificial
            Intelligence You can consider machine learning as the sub-branch of
            AI. The founding idea of AI was to create such machines that can
            think and act like a human mind. Most of the AI-powered systems are
            capable of: • Learning • Planning • Reasoning • Problem-solving •
            Perception • Manipulation • Motion Machine learning also exhibits
            all of these attributes with some additional traits like
            evolutionary computation. These intelligent algorithms use different
            sets of information and data to make decision-based on the
            situations. Machine learning mimics the thinking approach of the
            human mind. The best examples of machine learning in practical life
            are autopilot for planes and autonomous cars. Categories of Machine
            Learning At a higher level, machine learning is divided into two
            main categories. Both categories use different approaches to feed
            machines and systems with relevant data and information. 1.
            Supervised Learning In supervised learning, machines are taught to
            perform specific actions and movements by using different examples.
            Imagine if you want a system that can identify different digits, the
            system will be fed with several labeled images. Machine learning
            will analyze different patterns and pixels to identify each and
            every digit from the given data. Based on the analysis, the system
            will be able to distinguish different digits like 2, 4, and 9. You
            will have to provide a massive amount of data to teach a machine. In
            some cases, millions of examples are required to enable the system
            to accurately differentiate the objects. Labeling the data for the
            understanding of the machines is a time taking process. Some
            services use manual ways to label data, but Facebook uses publically
            available data to teach the systems. ImageNet is a huge collection
            of images, and this database was labeled by 50,000 people over a
            long period of two years. 2. Unsupervised Learning Instead of using
            different examples to operate, unsupervised learning uses different
            algorithms and patterns to categorize the given databases on their
            similarities or differences. The categorization of houses available
            for rent on Airbnb is the perfect example of unsupervised learning.
            Google News puts different relevant news in one category, is also an
            example of unsupervised learning. The smart algorithms are the base
            of unsupervised learning that enables the machine to sort out any
            type of data on the basis of their anomalies. What is Deep Learning?
            Machine learning is further broken down to another branch, deep
            learning. Computer vision and voice recognition are the perfect
            examples of deep learning where neural networks are expanded into
            the system. Recurrent neural networks are generally used in the
            systems for voice recognition, and convolutional neural networks are
            generally utilized in the image recognition systems. Why is Machine
            Learning Successful? Machine learning and AI are not new techniques.
            These concepts have been around for a long time, but people have
            started taking a lot of interest in the practical applications of
            these technologies for the last few years. In the sectors of
            computer vision, image recognition, and voice recognition, machine
            learning did miracles. The availability of the massive amount of
            data and efforts of researchers are the main reasons behind the
            successful applications of machine learning in different fields. The
            resources to train systems with machine learning are available
            online for the public. You can use image databases of Google and
            Amazon to teach your systems. Companies have started the production
            of machine learning systems at the industrial level. Conclusion
            Machine learning and AI are the pillars of the modern internet.
            Various smart technologies and tools use machine learning and AI for
            efficient and accurate working of machines. The suggested products
            on your Amazon profile and recommended series on Netflix are the
            results of machine learning. These systems analyze the user’s
            activity and intent to suggest the best suitable products. Google
            uses machine learning in the searching algorithms to serve users
            with the most accurate and relevant data according to his intent and
            requirements. Although recent developments in machine learning have
            made systems more accurate and reliable, it will take some more time
            to replace humans from industries. Researchers are working on
            expanding the scope of machine learning and AI for the public, and
            the results are going to be astonishing in the near future.
