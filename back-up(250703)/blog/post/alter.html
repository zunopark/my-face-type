          <p>
            Despite the shrinking size of microchips eventually they won't get
            any smaller. What will we turn to then? Today computers keep getting
            smaller and smaller, disk space gets bigger, processors get faster
            and overall computers are advancing at an amazing rate. Moore’s Law
            says that our computing power will continue to double every two
            years and up till now it has been surprisingly accurate, but
            eventually standard electronics, silicon circuits, hard drives and
            flash drives will reach their limits. Someday it will be impossible
            to fit any more transistors on chip, impossible to make our computer
            run any faster, unless we rework the whole way our computers are
            run. That is the purpose of this article, to explore the alternate
            possibilities for computing and their flaws/drawbacks. Optical
            Computing: Optical computing is one of the first possibilities for
            an electronic alternative, that would allow for near boundless
            advances in speed and miniaturization. An optical computer is a
            computer that uses photons and light instead of electrons to store
            and work with data. With modern computers we are limited to the
            speed of the electron, which although is astoundingly fast just
            sometimes doesn’t cut it. On the other hand photons are the fastest
            thing in the universe, traveling almost 10 times faster than an
            electron. This would significantly speed up processors, and data
            manipulation. The other thing to consider is that photons are
            actually mass less and so could possibly store hundreds of times
            more information. Where are they? To make an optical computer, one
            would need to use an optical transistor, a device that could amplify
            or switch on and off light beams. An optical transistor has to be
            made out of a very special material, that can respond to the amount
            of light passing through it, and output a relative amount of light,
            similar to a transistor reacting to the amount of voltage run
            through it. These materials have what is called a nonlinear
            refractive index and are basically non-existent in nature. A
            refractive index is the measure of how much the speed of light is
            reduced inside the medium. For a normal linear refractive index this
            number is usually constant and so would not make a good switch; on
            the other hand a non-linear refractive index can change depending
            upon the intensity of the light entering the medium. The problem is
            that these materials are rare, and not easy to mass produce. There
            are also problems with making these materials into small enough
            switches to be considered, so it may be a while before you can go
            out and buy an optical computer. This is a simple Quantum Computer.
            Yeah simple Quantum Computing: The next possibility for a future
            computer is a quantum computer. Normal computers store their
            information in electron containers, where a full container would
            indicate a 1 and an empty container would indicate a 0. A quantum
            computer on the other hand stores its information in the quantum
            states of particles like atoms, ions, photons and electrons. Because
            it stores information in quantum states a Quantum computer is able
            to have more than just a 1 or a 0 allowing for thousands of
            different calculations per second. This would allow a quantum
            computer to run in the same way a supercomputer does, processing
            many different parts at the same time. A normal computer on the
            other hand usually only processes one thing at a time, unless you
            have a dual processors than you can go through 2 processes at a
            time. It is estimated that a quantum computer could run a
            milliontimes faster than computers we have today using this parallel
            computing. Where are they? Actually household quantum computers may
            not be that far away. Scientists have already built powerful working
            16 bit quantum computers and some say that they could even be mass
            produced as early as October of this year. One of the only
            restrictions is that the computer would have to be completely
            isolated from all atoms, molecules etc. except for its reading and
            storage atoms. This is extremely hard to do outside of a lab because
            one needs a material that can keep everything out. In each strand of
            DNA there are billions of nucleotides which could be used to solve
            complex mathematical problems. DNA Computing: The final form of
            computing that is a possible alternate for silicon resistors is DNA
            Computing. A computer like this would use the millions of
            nucleotides in DNA to store data and do extremely complex
            computations in short periods of time. The core idea behind a DNA
            computer is the floating fragments of DNA that it will contain. The
            DNA can be spliced together with another piece of DNA, broken apart,
            split in half, etc. to make a unique possibility which can then be
            read and determined to either be valid or invalid. Basically DNA
            will use a brute force attack on any problem it has using billions
            of strands of DNA to try billions of possibilities at once. Because
            of this it can run in much the same way as a quantum computer in
            terms of parallel computing but it also has another set of distinct
            differences that make it a good choice for a future computer. For
            example DNA will always be plentiful as we could harness it from any
            organism, even our own bodies. Also it is compact, if we could fully
            unlock the power of DNA a pound could match the entire storage
            capacity of every computer made today. Where are they? Simple DNA
            computers have already been built, but they are still in very
            prototypic stages. The trouble with DNA computing, is reading the
            DNA computations and determining whether they are correct or
            incorrect and what to do with them. Also DNA computers are more
            built towards solving equations than running games, word processing,
            etc. This means that it could be a long time until a desktop DNA
            computers is sold in stores. There are other possibile silicon
            alternates, but these are the three that I found more interesting. I
            hope you enjoyed learning about this, and maybe something else will
            come along that will blow these out of the water, only time will
            tell. Did you like this post? Check out the others, subscribe to the

            the world are coming together to protect Net Neutrality Hey, guys
            today I’m going to talk about an issue that could ruin the Internet
            as we know it if we don’t join together to stop it. I am of course
            talking about Net Neutrality. This is kind of a hard concept to
            understand and I myself have just fully comprehended it today, but
            I’ll try to explain it in this article. Net Neutrality is really
            just an argument about who can control the Internet, the government
            or the corporations. Right now the net is open to almost everyone,
            any kid with a modem can go online and they can look at blogs,
            sites, images, videos, or really whatever they want to look at, at
            the highest speed that their connection can support. This is the
            concept of Net Neutrality, that the cable and telephone companies
            can not interfere with your information or the speed that some sites
            reach you. Unfortunately due to our capitalistic society some of the
            head honchos at these cable and telephone companies realized that
            they could make more money from the Internet if they charge for
            faster speed. This would completely destroy, the ideals of equality
            and connection on the Internet. The big companies would be able to
            pay the tax, while millions of other sites would be shunned to the
            side and some even shut down if they couldn’t pay off the cable
            companies. This would create a one-way media, where only big
            companies could get in and turn it into something like T.V., Radio,
            or Newspapers, all controlled by a few big companies. This is not
            something we can let happen to the Internet, because it’s the
            multitude of views and opinions that make it such a great medium for
            just about everything. Please help the millions of Americans and
            myself in ending corporate influence on the Internet, you can go to
            this site http://www.savetheinternet.com, send a letter to your
            members of congress, or just spread the word. Together we can keep
            the internet from falling into corporate hands like newspapers,
            television, and radio, lets keep the internet in the hands of the
            people. Did you like this post? Check out the others, subscribe to

            optimisation, achieve high position with Google In our opinion the
            main purpose for having a website is often overlooked! It is all
            very well having a great look site but if it is not generating
            traffic then there is little chance it will be developing sales
            leads & potential business. If that is the case then what is the
            point in having a website & what does it achieve? As the majority of
            users search using the search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo & MSN)
            then it is imperative that a site performs well in the search engine
            results. Search engine optimisation is the process of building a
            website to achieve a high position with the search results. This
            involves the following:

            keyword research building & optimising the web page code (HTML)
            correctly using the keywords correctly with the webpage submit the
            site to the search engines & directories monitoring search engine
            results keyword research Keyword research is the process of
            identifying the keywords that are relevant to your business &
            choosing the ones that are effective. Some keywords are so popular
            that it would be very difficult to acheive a good search engine
            placement due to the number of sites competing. Equally there is
            little point targetting obscure keywords if they are rarely searched
            for. web page optimisation The search engine spiders like to see
            well written & lean code as it makes their job of finding the all
            important content easier. In addition, writing well constructed code
            makes maintenance easier. correct use of keywords How the keywords
            are used in the webpage is critical to achieving a high search
            engine placement. This involves the frequency of use (keyword
            density), placement, positioning & other techniques. site submission
            The site should be submitted to the search engines & website
            directories if not already done so. website monitoring An important
            aspect of SEO is the monitoring of the sites ranking & position
            within the search engine results. The search engines often change
            their algorithms for determining site ranking & as a result sites
            can move up & down the results. Contact IPL by completing the online
