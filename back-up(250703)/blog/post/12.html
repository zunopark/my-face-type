            Social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have
            millions of active users. It means that you can reach millions of
            new users to sell your products and services with social media
            marketing. 63% of customers prefer to use the customer support of
            different brands through social media platforms instead of email and
            phone calls. Almost every brand out there has some kind of social
            media presence. Many businesses are solely based on their social
            media following. Machine Learning and Social Media Marketing Today,
            mastering the art of social media marketing is critical for business
            success. Social media platforms are introducing the latest tools to
            assist businesses in their social media marketing campaigns. Most of
            these social media marketing tools and strategies are based on
            machine learning and AI. The use of machine learning for social
            media marketing enables businesses and marketers to generate more
            leads and sales with targeted marketing. 1. Social Media Monitoring
            Most of the social media platforms have their built-in monitoring
            tools for analytics. Like on Instagram and Facebook, you can analyze
            the number of likes and comments on your posts. You can also analyze
            the reach of all posts to determine which posts are doing better in
            terms of user engagement. There are some 3rd party tools too that
            can be used to enhance social media marketing efforts. The use of AI
            and machine learning suggests the businesses with the best possible
            edits and recommendations based on the performance of their
            strategies. 2. Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis is the advanced
            application of machine learning, and it is also known as emotion AI
            or opinion mining. This technique analyzes the user intent based on
            the nature of the text. The process of sentiment analysis uses both
            machine learning and Natural Language Processing to determine the
            nature of the text. Businesses and marketers use sentiment analysis
            to gather public feedback and reviews about their newly launched
            products and services. The use of this process can also help the
            business to understand the behavior of their audience towards their
            competitors. 3. Image Recognition Machine learning can produce
            results for any brand logo or mark without using any kind of extra
            information and text. Businesses use a machine learning approach to
            detect their brand logo and products. Just imagine that an online
            user uploaded a photo of the product with your logo to social media,
            and he wants to know where he can buy this product. If you can
            timely detect that post with machine learning, you can convert that
            visitor to your potential client. 4. Chatbots for Social Media
            Marketing User engagement is one of the most important factors of
            social media marketing. Instead of hiring a team of customer support
            agents for 24/7 duty, you can use smart Chatbots for your business.
            These intelligent Chatbots are powered by machine learning and can
            respond to the user’s query according to his intent. More engagement
            with visitors can help you land more clients and make more sales
            with the least investment in human resources.
