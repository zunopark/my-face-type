            Five Reasons You Need A Facebook Fan Page Community building Search
            Engine Optimization In-depth analytics Communication It’s completely
            free Learn How To Market Your Tourism Business on Facebook. Facebook
            is a massive social networking site. By it’s very nature, Facebook
            lets people connect up to groups, people, events and fan pages,
            based on their interests. On the other hand, Facebook lets marketers
            connect up to people using Facebook Ads, based on the interests they
            have expressed through word, and by preferences they have indicated
            through action. Recently I have been working with two artists to
            help them connect up with people by using Facebook as a starting
            platform. These artists are local watercolour painters with amazing
            skill and a small inventory of beautiful paintings to sell. They
            have an established and growing reputation, and need an online
            presence to help promote their work. They are both new to Facebook,
            and don’t have a history of personal data on their profiles. In
            fact, they haven’t been actively growing their friends list at all.
            This is good – both artists were OKay with the idea of using a
            business page on Facebook as a marketing tool – and only use their
            personal profile as a personal way to connect with family. 5 Steps
            to Get Established in Facebook: Step 1 Find people with a similar
            interest. Join several Facebook groups in the subject area of your
            target Niche. Step 2 Build you friends list. Review the Members List
            from these group for individuals who match the profile for your
            ideal customer and invite these people to become your friend. Step 3
            Create an Interest Group. Make your own original Facebook Group and
            invite your new friends to join. Establish a monthly activity to
            give group members some recognition. Step 4 Create a Facebook Fan
            Page – promote your Fan Page in your profile AND in your Group. Step
            5 Add the RSS Feed from your Blog to your Facebook Fan Page! Now you
            have established a growing presence in Facebook that is easy to
            update from an external blog or RSS feed! All of your Fans get a
            notification within Facebook each time you update your blog!
