          <p>
            In the article The Two Sides of a Document, we discussed the
            importance of not interfering with the creating mode during the
            development process. We recognized the fact that in a highly rigid
            process that involves much documentation to be written during the
            development, the creative flow is constantly interrupted. We also
            mentioned Mind Maps as a possible solution for keeping track of
            ideas and insights throughout the development process (which enables
            us to maintain a review process along the way), while reducing the
            overhead of writing a “real document”. Object-Oriented Analysis and
            Design are one of the most creative activities in the development
            process. Thus, we might benefit from reducing the overhead of using
            conventional tools when performing this activity. Since Mind Mapping
            is a great technique for open thinking (it doesn’t tie you to a
            rigid solution or way of thinking) and it promotes both creativity
            and flexibility, it is a great tool for an activity such as OOAD.
            This technique is very lightweight. It imposes almost no overhead.
            This means you can easily capture ideas, manipulate them and
            refactor the way you perceive the system without having to do a lot
            of work. This by itself is an enormous advantage, since it enables
            you to flow. It does not hold you back in the thinking process. You
            do not have to stop thinking while changing your model. Flow and
            flexibility are crucial in the initial stages of creating the
            design. At these stages, you frequently change aspects of your
            design. You might even change the way you grasp the entire system.
            If you are forced to spend time on technicalities (such as changing
            a UML model) you stop yourself from thinking. Every new idea you
            have might introduce quite some overhead on these technical details.
            A suggested implementation of OOAD using Mind Mapping was recently
            published at SharpDevelopment.com. This article is the first one in
            a series of articles exploring Mind Mapping as a tool for various
            software development activities. The article demonstrates how this
            technique could be using for OOAD. It also contains a real-world
            example of analysis done using Mind Mapping.
