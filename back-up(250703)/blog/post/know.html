          <p>
            The first condition required in order to be able to do quality work
            is to know exactly what is expected from you. Most of the time, this
            statement is associated with gathering accurate requirements and
            having the customer explain exactly what she is expecting. However,
            there are always another set of implicit requirements, apart from
            the customer's functional requirements. These requirements are
            derived from the quality standard of your organization. Let's take
            for example the quality of source code. An organization that does
            not let its developers know what is expected to them in order to
            produce quality source code, cannot expect them to write such code.
            This is like trying to conform to functional requirements without
            specifying them first. Yet, this is exactly what happens in many
            organizations. It is very common to have a coding standard document,
            which developers should comply with. Yet, such an organizational
            standard often describes nothing but technical aspects of writing
            source code, such as what notation to use, how a class name should
            be prefixed and what should the structure of the code comments be.
            With all due respect, source code could easily comply with such
            standards and still be of poor quality. In order to achieve real
            quality, the organization should deal with the essence of the
            problem: the design of a component, the structure of the code, the
            code complexity, and common coding errors. Naturally, this is hard
            to achieve in a written standard. So, the best approach to this
            problem is investing in education. There are many things an
            organization could do in order to get everyone to know the quality
            standard expected from them. The first thing is to establish a
            constant formal review that is oriented towards improvement instead
            of criticism. By letting developers know what their mistakes are and
            how they can avoid them the next time the organization can slowly
            direct them in the right direction. In addition, the organization
            can arrange for seminars in which case studies will be analyzed in
            order to identify quality soft-spots in source code and how it could
            be improved. Such simple measures will spread the word around: not
            only quality is important, now everyone knows exactly how to achieve
            it. Of course, the same idea could be easily applied to every other
            aspect of the development process: design, testing, developer tests,
            etc. Merely saying we need to improve quality is not enough. People
            should realize exactly how this could be achieved, by first knowing
            exactly what is expected from them. If quality is part of the
            requirements, it should be treated in the same manner.
