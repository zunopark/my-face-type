            Coronavirus or Covid-19 has disturbed the balance of life on planet
            earth. People are falling sick, and deaths due to this novel virus
            are increasing all over the world. Just three months back,
            everything was perfect, and people had a good time. But, something
            was coming our way, and we were not even prepared for that. Fighting
            Coronavirus Organizations and governments are spending millions of
            dollars on research and development of antidote for Covid-19.
            Standard technologies and medicines have been insufficient for the
            treatment of Coronavirus. The world is looking forward to novel
            technologies and solutions to fight Coronavirus. Coronavirus is not
            the problem of China only as almost 100 countries have been fallen
            victim to Covid-19. The use of artificial intelligence for the
            detection and treatment of Coronavirus holds good news for us.
            Technology leaders have jumped in the field to help the world fight
            against Coronavirus. Baidu, Alibaba, and Huawei are working on new
            projects to implement AI in initiatives against Coronavirus. Is AI
            mature enough for the treatment and detection of Covid-19? Can we
            expect any major breakthrough from tech leaders that are trying to
            use AI in the medical field? How can Artificial Intelligence help
            Fight Coronavirus? Artificial intelligence is already being used in
            every sector of life, and now is the time to implement it worldwide.
            From thermal scanners to the prediction of possible breakouts of
            Coronavirus, AI is helping the mission in every possible way. Here
            are some important developments by tech companies in fighting
            Coronavirus with AI. Track, Detect and Forecast Coronavirus Breakout
            With better and improved tracking of the virus outbreak, governments
            and departments can affectively tackle the Coronavirus infections.
            There are several startups and companies that are launching AI-based
            systems and cameras to analyze Coronavirus situations in different
            countries. BlueDot is an international disease surveillance services
            provider company that is using the power of AI in systems. They use
            smart algorithms to analyze the stats and updates on social media
            and different platforms about diseases. The powerful AI systems of
            BlueDot has informed about the Coronavirus outbreak in China even
            before the official announcement of China. In time detection of
            Covid-19 can help to fight the spread of the virus in any specific
            area. Coronavirus Diagnose with AI Infervision is a tech company
            that has introduced an AI-based system to boost and enhance the
            detection and diagnose the speed of Coronavirus. Normal systems and
            medical facilities take 15-20 minutes to analyze the CT scan of
            human, but with the innovative technology, CT scans can be analyzed
            in 20 seconds only. The use of AI solutions in the medical field
            during this time has reduced the workload of the medical staff, and
            they can get more done in less time. Alibaba has also engineered a
            perfect AI-based system that can detect the symptoms of Coronavirus
            with almost 96% accuracy. Healthcare Claim Processing Coronavirus
            had not only affected the medical staff, but other departments are
            overwhelmed due to the panic situation. Things are getting worse all
            over the world, and departments are failing at administrative tasks.
            Companies have introduced block-chain smart systems with a blend of
            AI to speed up healthcare claim processing. These technologies are
            reducing the face to face duration in every sector so that the
            spread can be eliminated. Medicine Delivery with Drones The use of
            AI in transportation is one of the biggest achievements of
            technology. From autonomous cars to cargo delivery with drones, AI
            is playing a key role everywhere. In the Coronavirus infected areas,
            humans cannot interact with the patients. In the quarantined areas,
            the medicines are being supplied to the patients with the help of
            AI-based drones. The best way to stop the spread of Coronavirus is
            to ensure the distancing from each other. With the help of drones
            and AI, human interaction with the infected people has decreased. As
            there is no physical contact with the infected area, the outbreak of
            Coronavirus can be controlled easily. Artificial Intelligence can
            speed up Treatment Discovery AI is not only beneficial for the
            detection of epidemics, but it can also help the faster development
            of treatments. Analyzing millions of health records for the
            detection of the virus can be a daunting task, but you can get it
            done with AI in seconds. Since 2010, there have been many
            breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence. From IoT to
            the use of artificial intelligence in the business sector, there is
            a lot to look for in 2020. The scope of artificial intelligence is
            beyond human imagination, and if you are a technology freak, knowing
            these trends is a must for you. Artificial intelligence is expected
            to revolutionize different aspects of life with newer methods of
            doing things. Some trends seem really promising for the betterment
            of human life, and some might consider this progress as a threat to
            the human race. Artificial intelligence is the backbone of the R&D
            sector in every field of life, so we use the same benefits of AI in
            the medical field. AI helped China with smart thermal cameras to
            detect and control the spreading epidemic. Robot Cleaners If you
            want to put people out of harm’s way, keeping them away from
            infected things and people is really important. In hospitals and
            medical facilities, nurses and doctors were being infected due to
            the spread of Covid-19. AI-powered smart cleaners have reduced human
            interaction in unnecessary tasks to control the spread of
            Coronavirus. Remote meetings and other novel technologies are using
            the power of AI. Conclusion The current situation is serious, and
            tech leaders are working to introduce the treatment of Coronavirus.
            The involvement of AI in the research and development of drugs have
            enhanced the production, and the good news is expected soon.
