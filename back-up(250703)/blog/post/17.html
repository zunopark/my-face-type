            Chatbots are the new hottest trend in the online business world.
            Businesses are using Chatbots to offer a better experience to their
            visitors. You can ask general questions regarding the services, and
            these automated response systems will answer your query. When it
            comes to customer service, Chatbots are critical for every business.
            Have you ever noticed that whenever you open the website of any
            business, a chat notification pops up? That is not a human being
            available for you but an automated program to assist you. What is
            Chatbot AI? Online Chatbots are AI-powered computer programs that
            can communicate with humans just like a professional assistant.
            These Chatbots use conversational AI to answer the queries of the
            visitors. These Chatbots are some sort of digital assistants that
            are programmed to answer some generic queries of the customers and
            visitors. Conversational Chatbots use the stored information to
            analyze the queries and then provide an immediate and effective
            response to the queries. Conversational Chatbots use both ways of
            communication i.e., text and audio. Facebook messenger is the
            perfect example of the use of AI in the Chatbots. Types of Chatbot
            AI You must understand that Chatbots are not some kind of magical
            tools, but these programs are powered by conversational AI. Chatbot
            AI uses highly complex algorithms to process the available data. The
            rules for the response of the user queries are already defined in
            the core of the Chatbots AI. Whenever a user types any question,
            Chatbots compare that query and keywords to the stored information.
            Most relevant information is displayed for the user that might help
            to solve his query. There are different models and architectures of
            Chatbots, and most of the time, two major types of Chatbots AI are
            used on different platforms. 1. Rule-Based Chatbots These Chatbots
            are the simplest form of conversational AI. Most of the small
            websites use these Chatbots where the user has to choose from the
            given options. The choice of the user at every step determines the
            next conversation. Facebook messenger is also using this type of
            Chatbots AI. Most of the other marketplaces like Amazon Chatbots and
            customer service chatbots are also using this type. Specifications
            of Rule Bases Chatbots • User is presented with specific options, so
            these Chatbots are only for simple scenarios • These Chatbots are
            most suitable for custom support operations • These are the simplest
            Chatbots that can provide information about basic operations like
            business hours, business address and delivery status, etc. 2.
            Conversational AI Chatbots These are the relatively smarter and
            better Chatbots and are also known as digital assistants. These
            Chatbots provide better and more customized answers to user queries.
            These Chatbots interact with the users just like a human and use
            different algorithms to provide a specific answer to different
            situations. Instead of picking from the given options only, users
            can ask queries and questions from these conversational AI Chatbots.
            As compared to the rule-bases Chatbots, conversational AI Chatbots
            use the true potential of AI and deep learning. Key Attributes of
            Conversational AI Chatbots • AI-powered Chatbots use the intent of
            the user to make the conversation more interactive • Conversational
            Chatbots use predictive intelligence to understand the user’s intent
            • These Chatbots use user behavior and other results to offer more
            personalized information How does Chatbot Work? The working of
            Chatbots is purely based on algorithms. The primary focus of these
            algorithms is to provide answers to user queries and requests by
            extracting the relevant information from the database. Once Chatbots
            are done with the analysis part, and relevant information has been
            extracted for the user, a personalized response is delivered to the
            user. There are three major classification methods involved in the
            working of Chatbots AI: Pattern Matching Chatbots use different
            pattern matches to respond to user’s queries. Artificial
            Intelligence Markup Language is the model of different patterns. The
            bots use patterns to get the right answer according to the query of
            the user. Relevant answers are presented to queries that correlate
            to these patterns. Natural Language Understanding The ability of
            Chatbots to understand the human language is known as NLU. The
            human-readable text is converted to the structured data so that the
            computer can understand it. There are three steps involved in the
            working of NLU: • Entities • Context • Expectations Natural Language
            Processing NLP allows the users to input voice or text data; then,
            the input is converted into structured data to make it
            understandable for the computer. The structured data is processed
            further to choose a relevant answer to the queries of the user. The
            major steps of NLP include: • Tokenization • Sentiment analysis •
            Normalization • Entity recognition • Dependency parsing Benefits of
            Chatbots AI for Business Chatbots can help you to scale your
            business and boost efficiency. Most of the users on your website
            would like to know more about your products and services. A smart
            Chatbot can help your visitors with the relevant information so they
            can make a better decision. From the sales point of view, Chatbots
            can help to boost your revenue. Almost 80% of companies are planning
            on using smart Chatbots AI for their business this year. Here are
            some major benefits of Chatbots for the business world: • Reduce
            customer waiting time • Better customer service • 24/7 availability
            of digital assistance • Improved customer engagement • Reduce the
            cost of customer service • Better lead generation due to interactive
            conversations Platforms to Build Chatbots If you want basic
            Chatbots, you don’t need to jump into the complex details of the
            programming and coding. There are many platforms where you can
            create Chatbots for your business without any programming and
            coding. Here are top platforms to create Chatbots: • CHATFUEL •
            BOTSIFY • FLOW XO • BEEP BOOP • BOTTR • MOTION.AI • CHATTYPEOPLE
            Conclusion Although Chatbots are pretty impressive these days a lot
            of improvements are needed in the working of Chatbots. With the
            improvement in artificial intelligence, betterment in the working of
            Chatbots is also expected. If you want to scale your business,
            having a Chatbot for your website can give your sales a real boost.
