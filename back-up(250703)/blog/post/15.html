          <p>
            Self-driving cars always fascinated the users and automotive
            manufacturers. For the recent few years, we have seen humongous
            progress in autonomous driving. Tesla, Honda, Google, and many other
            automobile manufacturers are in a race to introduce a completely
            self-driving car. Many self-driving cars are being tested for the
            launch, and the CEO of Ford has predicted that entirely self-driving
            cars will be available for public till 2030. The growth of
            self-driving cars is going to have an impact on all other
            industries, too, including every sector of life. AI and Self-Driving
            Cars When it comes to autonomous cars, it is impossible not to
            mention the use of AI. Complex algorithms of AI empower autonomous
            cars to navigate through streets, traffic, and other complex
            situations. The use of other assistive technologies like IoT,
            camera, and sensors made the job easier, and the efficiency of
            self-driving cars improved for public use. Artificial Intelligence
            for Autonomous Car Safety Companies have been trying to launch fully
            automated vehicles where the driver is no longer a requirement. AI
            uses the data and information from the surroundings to analyze and
            decide the best course of action while going through complex and
            complicated roads. The unpredictability of humans on the road
            requires autonomous cars to be efficient enough to avoid any kind of
            damage or incident on the road. AI can help to improve the safety of
            the automobile, and safety may include: • Emergency control of the
            car • Detection of factors in the surroundings • Following and
            understanding the traffic signals • Applying brakes and other
            security protocols in case of emergency • Monitoring of blind spots
            What are Autonomous Driving Cars? Self-driving car manufacturers aim
            to introduce vehicles that require little or no intervention of
            human beings. Self-driving cars use different kinds of technologies
            and sensors to detect and predict their surroundings. Cars with
            autonomous driving use the latest technologies like artificial
            intelligence, sensors, software, and connectivity to operate with
            the least human interaction. From the concept of self-driving cars
            to this date, there have been several upgrades and changes in the
            automotive sector: Level 0: Fully manual cars that we see on the
            road these days Level 1: Hands-on cars with a little touch of auto
            gear shifting Level 2: Vehicles that have auto acceleration and
            steering functionalities Level 3: Cars can identify the changes in
            the environment or road but still need human intervention Level 4:
            Where cars can control essential functions, still under development
            level Level 5: Cars will be able to operate everything automatically
            in complex situations and environments, these cars are supposed to
            be available till 2030 Conclusion Fully automated cars might take
            some time as all major car manufacturing companies are trying to
            take the lead in the autonomous cars manufacturing. As there are not
            any rules and regulations about the public use of autonomous cars,
            so, most of the states don’t allow automated cars on the road.
            Nevada was the first state of America to legalize the use of
            automated cars on public roads. The upcoming years are going to
            change the face of the earth with the boom of automated cars.
